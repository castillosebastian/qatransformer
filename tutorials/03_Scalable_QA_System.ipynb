By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction. Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of ''The Twilight Zone'' throughout 1986 and on ''Beauty and the Beast'' until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.\\n\\nWhen Martin was between Hollywood projects in the summer of 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called ''Avalon''. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 7, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '82c1368aa5fcae44b5cbda7d85f4197f', 'range': (0, 186)}, {'doc_id': '2ab1c9e627da8454e883ec988891dc22', 'range': (1042, 1173)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '943c2b8dde89495b4524b5d7735e965'}>,\n",

Putting ''Avalon'' aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that it was part of a longer story.

After Djawadi had seen the preliminary animated title sequence the visual effect artists were still working on, he was inspired to write the piece. Djawadi said he intended to capture the overall impression of the series with the theme tune.  The title theme is unusually long for a television series at nearly two minutes long, and cello was chosen as the main instrument for the music as he thought it has a \"darker sound\" that suited the series.  The main title theme may also be incorporated into other music segments within the show, particularly at climactic moments.\\n\\n===Houses and characters===\\nDjawadi composed an individual leitmotif or theme for each of the major houses, as well as for some locations and some characters.

The theme for House Stark is the first theme to be composed and is played on a cello. Most of the Stark characters only have variations on the same theme on cello. Arya Stark is the first of the house to have her own theme, first heard when she started her lesson on swordplay in episode three of season one, with the music featuring a hammered dulcimer. A new theme for Jon Snow, previously using only the House Stark theme, was created in the sixth season and prominently featured in the episode \"Battle of the Bastards\".

Rather than divide the text in half chronologically, Martin opted to instead split the material by character and location, resulting in \"two novels taking place simultaneously\" with different casts of characters. Published in 2005, \\'\\'A Feast for Crows\\'\\' is narrated primarily by characters in the South of the Seven Kingdoms and in the new locations of the Iron Islands and Dorne. \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\' features characters in the North and across the narrow sea, although Jaime Lannister, Cersei Lannister, Arya Stark, Areo Hotah and Victarion and Asha Greyjoy appear in both volumes.\\n\\nApproximately one-third of the published \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\' consists of material that had been written for the pre-split \\'\\'A Feast for Crows\\'\\', although much of this has been rewritten by Martin.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 16, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': 'e4b46b846dc5a9670a1a11792410204d', 'range': (0, 182)}, {'doc_id': '7fcd0f70d70e02ec7566967374fc75f0', 'range': (954, 1156)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '7bbd3364b026fa497256948cc4edb618'}>,\n",

Going into filming, one of McLachlan\\'s most desired effects was the amount of smoke on the battlefield, saying \"we wanted to block the sun out so the shots would have some consistency. And I knew the fire and smoke would be incredibly beautiful.\"White smoke was used towards the beginning of filming, but as the battle went on, McLachlan decided to switch to black smoke, which was accomplished through burning diesel oil. This caused the crew to be required to wear masks and goggles, and raised concern for HBO\\'s safety officer, who eventually prohibited further use of the black smoke due to health and safety concerns.
